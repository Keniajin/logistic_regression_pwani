## Use the dataset ond15p.csv

- Explore the association between microfilarial infection and optic nerve disease by modelling Ond (optic nerve disease) with Mfpos (microfilarial positve/negative)
	- add sex (male/female) to mfpos; and then agegrp to mfpos (separately)

- Tabulate ond and agegrp- calculate the chi test

- Compute the odds ratio of optic nerve disease in the various age groups 
- Comment on the Wald test and the 95% CI

- Test whether adding agegroup into the model with mfpos and sex already in it improves model fit and comment on your findings
